# MFS | Map File Structure

## Description

MFS is a command line tool that allows you to make quick and easy mappings of given directories and all of their sub-directories. The generated mapping is stored in a plist or text file.

## Use

To use this tool, simply call `mfs [options] -i inputPath` where *inputPath* is the directory that you want to map. Included are many options that can be used to specify, in great detail, what files to include, how to output the mapping, and where the mapping should be output to.

For a full list of options, run `mfs -h` or `mfs —-help`.
